# Reflections

## Were your predictions right?
Yes, it was kind of easy to tell by looking at my object array.

## What surprised you?
The biggest suprise was how well this all runs in Chrome. I was able to paste the whole file in and run it and do some tests.

## What was tricky or rewarding?
I got bit by a case issue where my array in the mostFrequentMood function was all lower case. This caused an issue when I was trying to match it up with the weekdata arry elements. I put in a bunch of console.log lines to figure out what was going on. I then noticed the NaNs coming from the array and realized the case was different.

## How did using your own data change things?
It showed that I don't drink much coffee and my focus seems to be ok? I guess the outcome would be dfferent with someone elses data.
